# Chatbot Tutorial

This is a restructuring of the 
[PyTorch chatbot tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html).


Almost everything is the same except some functions have been split and rename for clarity
(for myself at least). The goal was to make the long form interactive script structure
more like a regular deep learning project with separate scripts and directories.


Structure:
```bash
.
├── README.md
├── chatbot_tutorial.py
├── data
│   └── lines_of_pairs_movie_lines.txt
├── dataset.py
├── models.py
└── preprocess.py
```
